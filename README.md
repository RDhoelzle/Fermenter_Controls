# Fermenter_Controls
Control and data logging programs for fermentation experiments

Electroferm_Control.ino and OLR_Control.ino are Arduino-based control programs for running the triplicate of electro-fermentation reactors and the single loading rate reactor, respectively.

EF Run.vi and OLR Run.vi are LabVIEW-based data logging programs which read in feed and effluent volumes, pH, and temperature for all reactors, and store the data in an excel-readable table with a time stamp every 5 minutes.
